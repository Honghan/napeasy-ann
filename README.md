# Annotating published studies for knowledge discovery on correlating mental diseases and environmental factors
This repo constains two resources: 
* [A browser based annotation tool](src):  PsychoEnv-Ann is a google chrome extension to support browser side annotations for literature on neurodegenerative disorders. The source code is available [here](src) and can be loaded in your Chrome as it is.
* [psycho-env corpus](psycho-env): Psycho-env corpus is a database manually curated from the published literature for studying the associations between mental illnesses and environmental factors. 

Update:
* PsychoEnv-Ann Annotator v1.0 has been implemented for supporting browser based annotation. Although it should work for any
web pages, it has been developed and tested on PubMed articles.
* 20 articles have been identified for 4 sub-domains of associating mental illness with environmental factors
* Abstracts of the 20 articles have been annotated and uploaded
